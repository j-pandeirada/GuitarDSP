# GuitarDSP
I decided to learn more about DSP algorithms for guitar pedal effects. The main objective of this repository is to 
test and understand the underlying algorithms and mathematical concepts of this effects, for future implementation in
real hardware in order to create my own pedals.
Some of the effects that im interested in:
-Distortion
-Delay
-Chorus
-Reverb
-Flanger
-Overdrive
-Fuzz
-Tremolo
-Wah-Wah
-Phaser
-Echo
